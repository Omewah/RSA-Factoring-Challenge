0. Factorize as many numbers as possible into a product of two smaller numbers.

	i. Usage: factors <file>
		a. where <file> is a file containing natural numbers to factor.
		b. One number per line
		c. You can assume that all lines will be valid natural numbers greater than 1
		d. You can assume that there will be no empy line, and no space before and after the valid number
		e. The file will always end with a new line
	ii. Output format: n=p*q
		a. one factorization per line
		b. p and q don’t have to be prime numbers
		c. See example
	iii. You can work on the numbers of the file in the order of your choice
	1v. Your program should run without any dependency: You will not be able to install anything on the machine we will run your program on
	v. Time limit: Your program will be killed after 5 seconds if it hasn’t finish
	vi. Push all your scripts, source code, etc… to your repository
		a. we will only run your executable factors

1. RSA Laboratories states that: for each RSA number n, there exist prime numbers p and q such that

n = p × q. The problem is to find these two primes, given only n.

This task is the same as task 0, except:

	i. p and q are always prime numbers
	ii. There is only one number in the files
How far can you go in less than 5 seconds?

	iii. Read: RSA Factoring Challenge
